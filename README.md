# Just a simple Random Forest Classifier for Covertype Data Set

```
Accuracy on test data: 0.9509
```

Observation:
---
The class labels are not at all balanced, hopefully, in the future, I will look into it more and balance the dataset. The issue is, due to the presence of instances belonging to classes 1 and 2 are higher than other instances, the model is biased towards this class label. Therefore, this issue must be addressed.
